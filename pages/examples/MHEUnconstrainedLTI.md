# Introduction

In a **centralized** setting, the **Kalman filter** achieves **optimal** performance recursively.\\
In a **decentralized** setting, recursive filters (Luenberger observers), are greedy and compromise long-term performance.\\
Surprisingly, in a decentralized setting, the **moving horizon estimation** (MHE) framework, even for **linear unconstrained** systems achieves **significantly higher performance** than Luenberger-based filters.
{: .text-justify}

In [[1]](#references) a **novel MHE framework** and the **moving finite horizon (MFH)** method are proposed, to achieve higher performance in a decentralized setting with a focus on the **implementation feasibility** for **very large-scale** networks of systems. See [documentation for MHEMovingFiniteHorizon](/documentation/MHEMovingFiniteHorizon/) for more information on the implementation of the MFH method.
{: .text-justify}

This example contains **extensive numerical simulations** to assess the performance of the proposed **MHE filter framework** and of the **MFH method**.

To open this example execute the following command in the MATLAB command window
~~~m
>> open MFH_SimulationResults

# Simulation results


The performance of the **novel MHE framework** and the **moving finite horizon (MFH)** method are compared against:
- Centralized solution
- One-step method [[2, Section 4]](#references) ([documentation](/documentation/kalmanOneStepLTI/))
- Finite-horizon method [[2, Section 5]](#references) ([documentation](/documentation/kalmanFiniteHorizonLTI/))
- PMHE1 method [[3]](#references)
{% comment %}- $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm minimization synthesis using $\mathcal{P}-\mathcal{K}$ iterations inspired in [[3]](#references) and [[4]](#references){% endcomment %}

The one-step and finite-horizon methods are based on a **Lueberger observer** and the PMHE1 method is a state-of-the-art **distributed MHE** solution whose **communication, computational, and memory requirements** are of the same magnitude as those of the MFH method.

All the functions, scripts, randomly generated models (and their generation parameters) **are available in the example folder**.

## Small network

Let's start with a rather small network of $N = 20$ systems. This network can be generated randomly using the function
~~~m
>> rng_seed = 1;
>> generate_random_network(rng_seed);
~~~
~~~text
Global state size: 40
Maximum absolute eigenvalue: 1.17425
~~~
The parameters inside ```generate_random_network``` can be adjusted to modify various parameters, e.g. the strength of the coupling between systems. This system was generated with coupled process noise, which is not supported by the PMHE1 method. For an example with the comparison with the PMHE1 method jump to [Large-scale network](#large-scale-network) and [Large-scale network with weak couplings](#large-scale-network-with-weak-couplings).

We obtain the following topology

The performance of the different decentralized methods is graphically depicted below
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_small_net_perf.svg" width="70%"></p>

It is interesting to note that since the MFH method with $W_{ss} = 1$ and the OS method are equivalent, theire performance is the same.

We choose $W_{ss} = 5$ henceforth. It is also interesting to see the evolution of the estimation error covariance throughout the last iteration of the MFH algorithm, i.e. $\mathbf{P}(\tau \mid \tau \mid k), \tau = k-W_{ss},\ldots,k$, which is the [third output of the MFH synthesis method](/documentation/MHEMovingFiniteHorizon/).

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_small_net_ev_trace.svg" width="70%"></p>

Notice that:
- Since **convergence was reached**, the trace at the beginning and end of the window is **equal**
- The estimation performance in the **middle** of the window is **very poor**
- But, it allows for a **very good estimate at the end of the window**
- Because the intermediate estimates **do not compromise future performance**
- This is the principle behind the **performance improvement** of the **MFH method**

Before deploying the MFH synthesis over the network, one can assess its **stability** by making use of the stability condition in [[Section II.B,1]](#references).
~~~m
>> model = 1;
>> Wss = 5;
>> stability_mfh(model,Wss);
~~~
~~~text
MFH synthesis is stable.
~~~
Which confirms that the **MFH synthesis** that was obtained is **stable**.

Let's assess the performance of the different estimation solutions resorting to Monte Carlo simulations:
~~~m
>> model = 1;
>> parameters = struct('sim_T',100,'MFH_w_ss',5,'mc_it',1e4);
>> methods = [true; true; true; true; false];
>> simulation_mc(model, methods, parameters);

After 10000 Monte Carlo simulations the evolution estimation error covariance is depicted below
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_small_net_mc.svg" width="70%"></p>

The steady-state trace of the estimation error covariance matrix is depicted below, which was obtained by averaging the 25 last instants of the MC simulations.

| | C | OS | FH | MFH ($W_{ss} = 5$) |
|:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{P_{\mathrm{MC}}})$ | 30.15 | 59.21 |  48.51 | 46.03 |
| Relative to MFH |  $-34.49\%$ |    $+28.63\%$ |  $+5.39\%$ | $--$  |

**Conlusions**:
- The MFH method **converged** for different window sizes
- The MFH method seems to have **faster synthesis times** than the FH method
- It was confirmed that the MFH gain synthesis is **stable**
- The MFH method **performs better** than state-of-the-art decentralized Luenberger-based filters
- The **principle** behind the performance of the MFH is evident for this example
- The use of the second best performing method (FH) incurs in a **performance penalty** of  $+5.39\%$

It is very important to note that the projected performance that is output by the implementation of the methods **may have a lower precision** than the displayed significant digits. It depends on the convergence criteria chosen for each method. One can compute the precise projected performance of the synthesis by making use, for instance, of the initial projection performed in ```simulation_mc```. For the MFH synthesis, with $\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{P}_{\infty}^{\mathrm{Cent}}) = 844.1$, we get

| $W_{ss}$ | | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|:- |:-  | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $\text{tr}(\mathbf{P}_{\infty})$ |/$\;\;\;\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{P}_{\infty}^{\mathrm{Cent}})$ | $1.911$ | $1.764$ | $1.647$ | $1.590$ | $1.555$ | $1.520$ |

The performance of the different decentralized methods is graphically depicted below

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_net_perf.svg" width="70%"></p>

We will consider $W_{ss} = 5$ henceforth.

Similarly to the previous synthetic network ([Small network](#small-network)), we can observe the evolution of the trace of the covariance over the window of the last iteration of the MFH method. The same conclusions apply.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_net_ev_trace.svg" width="70%"></p>

Before deploying the MFH synthesis over the network, one can assess its **stability** by making use of the stability condition in [[Section II.B,1]](#references).
~~~m
>> model = 40;
>> Wss = 5;
>> stability_mfh(model,Wss);
~~~
~~~text
MFH synthesis is stable.
~~~
Which confirms that the **MFH synthesis** that was obtained is **stable**.

Lastly, we can check if the PMHE1 method is guaranteed to converge (with a window size equal to the size chosen for the MFH method)
~~~m
>> farina_et_al_2010_convergence(40,5);
~~~
~~~text
PMHE1 is not guaranteed to converge.
~~~
We conclude that the **PMHE1 method is not guaranteed to converge**. Note that we considered the process noise between coupled systems to be **correlated**, which **PMHE1 does not support**. Nevertheless, the convergence analysis only depends on $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{C}$, so that had no influence. Also note that, according to [[3]](#references), there is no indication that it does not converge (it is just not guaranteed to converge).

Removing correlations between process noise of coupled systems (model ```model41```), we can run a simulation to see whether the error dynamics of the PMHE1 method are stable

~~~m
>> model = 41;
>> parameters = struct('sim_T',1,'PMHE1_N',5);
>> methods = [true; true; false; false; true];
>> simulation(model, methods, parameters);

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_net_pmhe1_div.svg" width="70%"></p>

We conclude that, even without process noise correlations, the **PMHE1 method does not converge** for this network.


Let's assess the performance of the different estimation solutions resorting to Monte Carlo simulations:
~~~m

After 1000 Monte Carlo simulations the evolution estimation error covariance is depicted below
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_net_mc.svg" width="70%"></p>

The steady-state trace of the estimation error covariance matrix is depicted below, which was obtained by averaging the 20 last instants of the MC simulations.

| | C | OS | FH | MFH ($W_{ss} = 5$) |
|:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{P_{\mathrm{MC}}}) \times 10^{-3} $ | 0.8449 |  1.797 |  1.451  | 1.348 |
| Relative to MFH |  $-37.34\%$ |    $+33.29\%$ |  $+7.59\%$ | $--$  |

In [[1]](#references) it is argued that the MHE filter synthesize with the MFH method is **consistent**. We can perform a simulation and look at a component of the estimation error to confirm that.
~~~m
>> model = 40;
>> parameters = struct('sim_T',1000,'MFH_w_ss',5);
>> methods = [true; true; true; true; false];

The evolution of a randomly chosen component of the error and the corresponding $3\sigma$ bounds is depicted below.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_net_3sigma.svg" width="70%"></p>

We can confirm that it is **zero-mean** and the calculated estimation covariance is **not over-confident**.

**Conclusions**:
- The **PMHE1** method **does not converge**
- The **MFH** method **converges** for different window sizes
- The **MFH** method supports **correlated process noise**
- The **MFH** method is **scalable**
- It was confirmed that the MFH gain synthesis is **stable**
- For low window sizes the **MFH** method is significantly **faster to synthesize** than the FH method
- The MFH method **performs better** than state-of-the-art decentralized Luenberger-based filters
- The use of the second best performing method (FH) incurs in a **performance penalty** of  $+7.59\%$
- The **MHE** framework of the **MFH** method is consistent

## Large-scale network with weak couplings


Let's increase the dimension of the network even more and generate a new model with $N = 1000$ systems. The parameters for the generation of this network are set so that:
- The dynamic **couplings** between systems are **weak** (so that the PMHE1 method converges)
- The **process noise** is **uncorrelated** between systems (to employ the PMHE1 method)

This is the second synthetic network used in [[1]](#references). This network was generated randomly using the function
~~~m
>> seed = 42;
>> generate_random_network(seed);
~~~
~~~text
Global state size: 2000
Maximum absolute eigenvalue: 1.13125
~~~

We obtain the following topology
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_weak_net.svg" width="80%"></p>

Lets's synthesize the centralized and OS methods

~~~m
>> synthesis_luenberger(42);
~~~

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was **not possible** to compute the **FH** synthesis in a reasonable amount of time (a few days).

Lets synthesize the MFH method with $W_{ss} = 2$

~~~m

Trace MFH/C: 2.601179
For W_ss = 2 (tr = 6722.96) elapsed time is 74398.1 seconds.
~~~

Before deploying the MFH synthesis over the network, one can assess its **stability** by making use of the stability condition in [[Section II.B,1]](#references).
~~~m
>> model = 42;
>> Wss = 2;
>> stability_mfh(model,Wss);
~~~
~~~text
MFH synthesis is stable.
~~~
Which confirms that the **MFH synthesis** that was obtained is **stable**.

Lastly, we find that the **PMHE1** method **is guaranteed to converge** (with a window size equal to the size chosen for the MFH method)
~~~m
>> farina_et_al_2010_convergence(42,2);
~~~
~~~text
PMHE1 is guaranteed to converge.
~~~

We can simulate this methods can be simulated using function ```simulation``` for $W_{\text{PMHE1}} = 2$ and $W_{\text{PMHE1}} = 5$. The evolution of the error norm is depicted below

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/mhemfh_large_weak_net_sim.svg" width="70%"></p>

The average of the error norm for each of the methods is depicted below

| | C | OS | MFH ($W_{ss} = 2$) | PMHE1 ($W_{\text{PMHE1}} = 2$) | PMHE1 ($W_{\text{PMHE1}} = 5$) |
| |:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 49.95 |  173.9 |  81.92 |  132.3 |  140.1 |
| Relative to MFH | $-39.02\%$ | $+112.3\%$ | $--$ | $+61.54\%$ | $+70.98\%$ |


**Conclusions**:
- The **FH** method **could not be synthesized** in a reasonable amount of time for $N=1000$ systems
- The **MFH** method is **scalable**
- It was confirmed that the MFH gain synthesis is **stable**
- The use of the second best performing method (PMHE1) incurs in a **performance penalty** of  $+61.54\%$
